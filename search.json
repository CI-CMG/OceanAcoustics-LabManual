    "text": "What to expect in the first 1 to 7 days\nPatience is key in the first week. Having to go through approvals, appointments and introductions your initial days may be overwhelming and delays getting fully onboarded are expected. However, as each day passes you will get your NOAA credentials - which will get you access to the building, your NOAA computer and then sort through the necessary access to servers, and get up to speed on what the archives are and what we do here at NCEI. There are required training courses from CU and NOAA that you will take online (see below) and several CU forms to complete that the CU team will walk you through..\nIn short, It’s a lot of paperwork, learning, waiting, and a bit of doing.\n\n\nWhat to expect in the first month\nAs access to all things NCEI are worked out over the first couple of weeks of the job, you should be well on your way to learning the tasks of the job, feeling integrated with the team and meeting many others in the office.\nThroughout this month, you will be given a lot of information and finding ways to document it, organize, and reference it will be very beneficial. The team has a couple of tools along with existing documentation - your help using these tools, providing feedback for what could be better, and additional information that is needed are always appreciated.\nHopefully be able to start doing your job :)))\n\n\nThings to configure\nHere are some onboarding guidelines so you know you are on the right track:Onboarding Guidelines\nIf you are a student joining the team you will most likely need to work on a Windows desktop. In order to access the servers and the mission’s systems, you will need to configure the terminal application called Putty:Putty Configuration\nAnother aspect of being a student employee includes updating your hourly timesheet each day.\nInstructions for configuration can be found here: Timesheet setup for Students\n\n\nTraining\nAs a NOAA and CU Employee, there will also be several training courses that you will be required to complete:\nNOAA training: NOAA IT Security Awareness\nNOAA training: Records Management Course 101\nCU training: Discrimination and Harassment\nCU training: Introduction to Export Controls\nOnce you’ve gotten this far, make sure you schedule a tour of the NOAA building! As one of the nation’s leaders in science and technology, the building houses several exhibits that detail the achievements of NOAA Boulder at the David Skaggs Research Center.",

    "title": "Submitting Archive Data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In order to support as many projects and data sources as possible, the Ocean Acoustics team has developed tools to standardize the way data are submitted to the archive.\nThe tools: - Enable easy entry of metadata by data providers, which it then uses to generate machine-parseable JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) metadata records - Copy all files identified to be sent to the archive to a specified location, such as an external hard drive - Create a checksum manifest file to ensure data integrity is maintained during transit\nThe tools automatically build a “data package,” a standardized structure that conforms to the BagIt specification, that efficiently feeds into the archive’s ingest pipeline.\n\nPreparing Water Column Sonar Data to Submit to the Archive\n\nCruisePack\nCruisePack is a free, stand-alone executable designed to simplify the packaging of cruise-based data for submission to the NCEI Water Column Sonar Data Archive. It is compatible with most computers and features an intuitive Graphical User Interface for entering metadata about the cruises and datasets.\n\nThe water column sonar database primarily maintains raw (as collected) data files in the instrument’s vendor-specific format (e.g., .raw, .wcd). However, other supplemental data (sound speed profiles, tides, vessel offsets, biological data, cruise reports, etc.) are also accepted.\nTo enable discovery and access of the data through the NCEI Water Column Sonar Map Viewer, please ensure navigation datagrams are included in the sonar data files (e.g., *.wcd).\nData can be submitted through shipping external hard drives, uploading to NCEI’s FTP server, or data copy using rsync through a secure shell login (Linux).\nFor more information on sending data to the water column sonar archive, see the WCSD tab of the Submission Guidelines.\n\n\nSupported Instruments / File Formats\nNCEI can accept files from most instruments capable of collecting water column sonar data. Currently supported instruments from these manufacturers include:\n\nKongsberg\n\nAll EM instruments that record in .wcd & .kmwcd format such as:\n\nEM122\nEM2040\nEM302\nEM3002\nEM710\n\nM3 instruments that record in .imb format\n\nSimrad\n\nMultibeam instruments that record in .raw format:\n\nME70\nMS70\n\nSinglebeam instruments that record in .raw format:\n\nEK500\nEK60\nES60\nEK80\nES80\n\n\nReson\n\nMultibeam instruments that record in .s7k format:\n\nSeaBat 7125\n\n\n\nIf your raw sonar data are not in one of the supported formats or from a sonar system not listed above, email wcd.info@noaa.gov to discuss options.\n\n\n\nPreparing Passive Acoustic Data to Submit to the Archive\nRecommendations for the passive acoustic community on formatting, metadata, and submitting passive acoustic data to the NCEI Passive Acoustic Data Archive can be found in the Archive Resources tab of the NCEI Passive Acoustic Data Archive project page .\n\nPassivePacker\nPassivePacker is the standalone executable with a Graphical User Interface to support preparation of passive acoustic datasets to be submitted to the archive. This tool works well for packaging a low number (&lt;10) of datasets.\nDetailed guidance on how to use PassivePacker can be found in the web-hosted manual.\n\n\nPACE\nThe Passive Acoustic Collection Engine (PACE) tool provides a programmatic approach to packaging passive acoustic data for submission to NCEI. PACE is designed for users with a  need to submit large numbers of datasets to NCEI and/or users who manage metadata in a system such as Tethys or a relational database. PACE can be controlled via a GUI or from the command line and supports user-created metadata spreadsheets or direct integration with database systems. PACE creates data packages like those created by PassivePacker without the need for PassivePacker’s manual metadata entry. Contact the team at pad.info@noaa.gov for more information on PACE.\n\n\nFile Formats\nThe passive acoustic data archive accepts both audio files and data products. Data can come from stationary marine, mobile marine or terrestrial deployments. Currently supported data products include sound level metrics, detections, sound propagation models, and sound clips. We are open to archiving other types of data products. Contact the archive team for more information.\nAudio files need to be in a standard format, such as .wav, x.wav, .aif, .flac or .mp3. Raw instrument file formats such as .dat are not accepted. Please contact the archive if you have questions regarding audio file formats. \nData product file formats include .csv, .txt., .nc, and .wav. Similar to the audio files, proprietary, software-specific formats are not allowed.\n\n\nAudio File Compression\nPassive acoustic data are voluminous. To save space in our storage systems and minimize the data volume for deliveries to end users, we use the Free Lossless audio Codec (FLAC) to compress the audio files before archiving. The .flac file format is natively supported by most processing software. However, if a user needs files in an uncompressed format, FLAC can be used  to decompress the files. The general command to decompress is flac -d &lt;filename&gt;.flac To ensure any third-party system metadata in the files is preserved, use the --keep-foreign-metadata control flag when decompressing. Additional information on using FLAC can be found on the FLAC command line page.\nFLAC compression will reduce files 50% or more depending on file characteristics, so we encourage data providers to FLAC compress their files before submitting to the archive. This allows a lot more data to be submitted at a time and saves time during the archiving step. PLease note, there are limitations in the number of channels that the flac compression can accommodate and flac does not provide any additional compression for .mp3 formats. Use the tag -keep-foreign-metadata when compressing the files to esure any metadata added by your processing software is retained. Please contact the archive if you have questions regarding FLACing your data before submission.\n\n\n\n\nSubmitting Data Packages to the Archive\nData packages can be submitted using several different pathways depending on your needs and size of datasets.\n\nShipping external hard drives\nUploading to NCEI’s FTP server\nTransferring by cloud\n\n\n\nShipping External Hard Drives\nNaming & labeling is really important! Your external hard drive cannot contain any spaces within its name. A good practice is to replace spaces with underscores. For example: “Seagate_Expansion_Drive”\nLabel the outside of your external hard drive with the following information. Please do not put the label over the hard drive’s serial number.\n\nWhen your drive is ready to ship, please contact the team pad.info@noaa.gov for a shipping address.\n2. Uploading to NCEI’s FTP server\nThis option is only available for low volume data, &lt;200 GB. Please work with the Ocean Acoustic team to determine if submitting data via FTP will work for you. \n3. Transferring by Cloud\nIn some cases, we can archive data that are on a cloud platform Some platform requirements include free egress for the NCEI Ocean Acoustic team and the bucket is within a NOAA FISMA boundary. We’ve successfully received data and subsequently archived data from cloud buckets before and hope to expand the occurrences of this pathway as more and more of our NOAA partners move their own data holdings to a cloud environment. Please contact the archive team for more information\n\n\n\nPrevious Page | Next Page",

Primary uses of this sonar data include mapping of fish schools and other mid-water marine organisms, assessing biological abundance, identifying species, and characterizing habitat . Additionally, it is used to map underwater gas seeps and remotely monitor undersea oil spills.\nThe Water Column Sonar Data Archive was established in collaboration with NOAA Fisheries and the University of Colorado in 2014. This archive preserves sonar data collected by NOAA line offices, academia, industry, and international institutions, offering free, global access to over 300+ terabytes of data. This valuable resource helps answer complex questions about our oceans and facilitates exploration beyond the data’s original collection purpose.\n\n\n\nWater column sonar data collected on the NOAA Okeanos Explorer in the North Atlantic Ocean. Sonar data are overlaid onto coastal relief model bathymetry.\n\n\nContact Us: wcd.info@noaa.gov\n\n\nPassive Acoustic Data Archive\nPassive acoustic monitoring is a powerful observational tool used by NOAA and other agencies to detect and characterize sounds produced by fish and marine mammals, ambient noise from physical oceanographic processes, and anthropogenic noise sources that contribute to the overall ocean noise environment. The Passive Acoustic Data Archive, established in 2017, supports the stewardship of these valuable data collected by NOAA and partners. The archive’s database schema was designed after Tethys, an open source temporal-spatial database for metadata related to acoustic recordings, developed by Dr.Marie Roche.\nThe archive hosts free, globally accessible raw audio files and data products, supporting scientific research and management needs such as monitoring and protecting marine mammal populations, tracking geological activity, and assessing the impacts of human noise on marine life. Notably, the NCEI Passive Acoustic Data Archive staff supported the NOAA-Navy Sanctuary Soundscape Monitoring Project (SanctSound) by stewarding hundreds of raw audio files and data products and developing an educational and interactive portal for the project.\nNotably, the NCEI Passive Acoustic Data Archive staff supported the NOAA-Navy Sanctuary Soundscape Monitoring Project (SanctSound) by stewarding hundreds of raw audio files and data products and developing an educational and interactive portal for the project.\n\n\n\nThere are three main sources of sound in the ocean: physical (green), biological (blue), and human-made (orange).Credit: NOAA NEFSC Passive Acoustic Research Group\n\n\n\n\n\nA wide range of technology is used to record underwater sound.
