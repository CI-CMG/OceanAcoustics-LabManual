This repository serves as the documentation for the CIRES Ocean Acoustics Lab Manual, built using Quarto and hosted via GitHub Pages. If you would like to replicate this setup for your projects, follow the instructions below.

This is a common format for documentation and includes a GitHub Action that automatically builds the website when changes are made. The NOAA palette and fonts have been added to theme.scss for consistent branding. The website will be served from the gh-pages branch, a common approach to prevent cluttering the main branch with website files.

The GitHub Action installs R to support R code in your .qmd or .Rmd files. There’s no need to modify existing.Rmd files unless you want to use specific Quarto features like cross-referencing.
